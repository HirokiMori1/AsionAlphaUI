At present, the focus of dynamic_reconfigure is on providing a standard way to expose a subset of a node's parameters to external reconfiguration. Client programs, e.g., GUIs, can query the node for the set of reconfigurable parameters, including their names, types, and ranges, and present a customized interface to the user. This is especially useful for hardware drivers, but has broader applicability.
