Metapackage of rqt plugins that are particularly used with robots during its operation.

To run any rqt plugins, just type in a single command "rqt", then select any plugins you want from the GUI that launches afterwards.

rqt consists of three following metapackages:

    rqt - provides a container window where all rqt tools can be docked at. rqt plugin developers barely needs to pay attention.
    rqt_common_plugins - ROS backend tools suite that can be used on/off of robot runtime.
    rqt_robot_plugins (You're here!)
